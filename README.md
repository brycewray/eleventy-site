# Repo for brycewray.com

This is the repository from which the [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev)-generated version of [brycewray.com](https://brycewray.com) is built. I suggest you use it **only for reference** and, rather than cloning or forking it, use one of the **starter sets** based on it (see below). It now uses the [Tailwind CSS JIT compiler](https://blog.tailwindcss.com/just-in-time-the-next-generation-of-tailwind-css) and, in production mode, features internal (`head`-based) CSS; it also includes [Alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine) for use by the navigation bar.

## Starter sets based on this repo

For a list of **starter sets** based on the design of the site that this repo builds, please see [this post on my website](https://brycewray.com/posts/2021/03/beginners-luck-update).

**Note**: If you insist of cloning or forking **this** repo (rather than one of the starter sets) for your use, be sure to change the `_data/metadata.json` file to reflect **your** information rather than mine.
