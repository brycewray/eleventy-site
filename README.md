# Repo for brycewray.com

This is the repository from which the [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev)-generated version of [brycewray.com](https://brycewray.com) formerly was built. I suggest you use it **only for reference** and, rather than cloning or forking it, use one of the **starter sets** based on it (see below).

## Starter sets based on this repo

For a **starter set** based on the design of the site that this repo builds, please see either [eleventy_solo_starter](https://github.com/brycewray/eleventy_solo_starter) or [eleventy_solo_starter_njk](https://github.com/brycewray/eleventy_solo_starter_njk). The former uses JavaScript (.11ty.js) templating; the latter uses Nunjucks templating.

**Note**: If you insist of cloning or forking **this** repo (rather than one of the starter sets) for your use, be sure to change the `_data/metadata.json` file to reflect **your** information rather than mine.
