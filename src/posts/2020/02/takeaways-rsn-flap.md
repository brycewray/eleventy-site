Nearly a century ago, a reporter asked Babe Ruth about the fact that his previous year's pay had been higher than that of the president of the United States. The Babe's famous response: "I had a better year than he did."

Ruth, arguably the greatest player in the history of baseball, played in an era when only the very top professional athletes made more than just enough to live a decent life. And that didn't change for a very long time---until the really large paychecks started becoming common in the 1970s and 1980s.

Fast-forward to today, when:

- One doesn't have to be even the best player on a team's *bench* to make millions, perhaps tens of millions, a year.

- The sports leagues (perhaps for that reason) live or die on massive outlays of money from the television networks that carry their games.

- The vast majority of those games' telecasts are controlled by dwindling numbers of providers which, exercising the muscle such a position gives them, are squeezing---or trying to squeeze---ever-greater fees from the services that bring those telecasts to viewers.

It's been over 150 years since professional sports began to captivate the hearts of fans. Now, all of this may finally have become unsustainable, a possibility I've been pondering for a while. It may well be that the pyramid is, at long last, toppling.

I was further prompted toward this conclusion yesterday, when YouTube TV---[my streaming provider of choice](/posts/2020/01/streamers-party)---announced that it, like several other TV services before it, is dropping the Sinclair-owned RSNs on which many sports fans depend to watch their favorite teams. The two sides just couldn't reach an agreement.

Before I go on, the obvious question is: "What's an RSN, and why should you care?"

## Balls and (network) chains

I'll address the second part of that question first: if you have little or no use for watching sports on TV, you probably *don't* care about RSNs. Still, please keep reading because there are some points ahead which may very well merit your attention and consideration, even if only on an academic basis.

An RSN is a *regional sports network*. Here in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, the main example is Fox Sports Southwest, which carries almost all the regular-season games for the Texas Rangers baseball team, the Dallas Mavericks basketball team, and the Dallas Stars hockey team. It also airs a variety of college and high school sporting events.

Wait a minute: it's *Fox* Sports Southwest? But didn't I say these were owned by Sinclair?

Yes. Last year, Disney bought many Fox properties, including its array of RSNs across the country. The FCC required Disney to divest itself of the RSNs, and Sinclair was the purchaser (even though it paid only about half of the $20 billion Disney was asking).

Sinclair now had to work out new arrangements with the various cable companies, satellite carriers, and streaming services that carried the RSNs. Unfortunately for fans who were cord-cutters, Sinclair chose to ask more than most streaming services---as well as Dish Network---were willing to pay; and, one by one, those services removed the RSNs. Yesterday, YouTube TV became the latest to do so.

## An end to some good times

I grew up a TV sports fan. My late father and I spent many a weekend afternoon watching ballgames together. Back then, there typically was only a nationally televised "game of the week" for us to see, usually on a weekend afternoon. This was long before the existence of RSNs---indeed, before the cable TV explosion that made them possible---and the resulting glut of daily and nightly games, college and pro, that have become common in recent years.

However, as one service after another drops RSNs because their source is too hard-nosed and the cost is simply too dear, I suspect I've reached the end of always being just one button-press away from seeing my local teams, a luxury (as it turns out) to which I'd become accustomed over the last decade and a half.

At this writing, there remain two streaming services that are still carrying the Sinclair-owned RSNs. Both cost more than the other services, and still don't pass my muster from a technical standpoint as well as YouTube TV does. So, although the Twitterverse and various online comments sections would lead me to believe I'm in the minority on this, I'm sticking with YouTube TV. Sinclair is known for its stubbornness (and, not to forget, being evil), so I doubt seriously there will be a resolution that fixes this mess. The other providers who dropped the Sinclair RSNs haven't come back, and I see no reason to believe YouTube TV will vary from that pattern.^[And you may be absolutely sure I have *no intention whatsoever* of backtracking to cable, and the humongous bills that accompany it, just to get the "local" RSN back. No way.]

## The shadow of the pyramid

All this leaves me as I was about twenty years ago where the local teams are concerned. I get to see their games *if* a national network is airing them, whether on local TV or a cable network. Since Dallas/Fort Worth teams don't get the exposure that West Coast and East Coast teams generally enjoy (*e.g.*, they're not part of that Yankees/Red Sox rivalry on which ESPN obsesses year after year), that means it'll be a pretty rare experience.

It was good while it lasted.

Beyond my own inconvenience, however, I wonder just how long the whole house of cards will survive.

Every month, tens of thousands more people cut the cord---often in favor of services that have *no* sports programming because that allows the services to charge less, freed of the growing fees demanded by the sports-specific networks like ESPN and the RSNs. And, almost as often, more non-cable TV services that *were* carrying the sports nets are dropping the increasingly expensive RSNs rather than pass along the costs to their subscribers.

As a result, the pool of TV money on which the pro sports organizations have depended will, inevitably, shrink.

Then what will the pro sports leagues do?

They can't cut the massive salaries the athletes make. That would result in strikes which would cripple the leagues, perhaps irrevocably.

They can't make it up by charging higher ticket prices. Actual attendance has very little to do with a team's income, compared to the mountains of money from broadcasters and cable networks.

I don't know where it all ends. But I don't plan to be standing anywhere near the shadow of the pyramid when that once-solid edifice starts making cracking noises---as, I suspect, will occur all too soon.
