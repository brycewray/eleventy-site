<div class="yellowBox"><p><strong>Note</strong>: Unlike the <a href="/posts/2020/09/normal-persons-guide-static-websites">last</a> <a href="/posts/2020/09/normal-persons-guide-static-website-hosting">two</a> posts, this one very definitely is for <strong>only</strong> my fellow web geeks&mdash;and, anyway, they&rsquo;re the only folks likely to be using <a href="https://firebase.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firebase Hosting</a>, I would think.</p></div>

I mentioned in a footnote to my [previous post](/posts/2020/09/normal-persons-guide-static-website-hosting) that my “[lurch](/posts/2020/09/goodbye-hello-part-5)” among hosts now has this site on Firebase. If you’ve read both the original “[Goodbye and hello](/posts/2020/07/goodbye-hello)” and its semi-[retconned](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/retcon-history-and-meaning) [second part](/posts/2020/07/goodbye-hello-part-2), you may remember my describing why I chose **not** to use Firebase. If so, you then may also wonder what changed my mind.

Actually, there were multiple reasons:

- Last month, [Firebase belatedly adopted Brotli compression](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2020/08/firebase-hosting-new-features.html), its previous lack of which had been a deal-breaker for me.
- I had already been an admirer of the performance of the [Fastly](https://fastly.com) content delivery network (CDN) that Firebase uses, and found it was consistently better than the CDN setups provided with the free tiers for the other three hosts I’d been using and testing ([Netlify](https://netlify.com), [Render](https://render.com), and [Vercel](https://vercel.com)).
- In the last few days, I tinkered around and was able to come up with a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) that made it possible to **deploy** (in Firebase terminology) to Firebase Hosting every time I pushed a change to the site repo’s default branch—*i.e.*, making it as easy as when using the repo with those other three hosts. Yes, you can just do a local site build and then invoke `firebase deploy`, but that’s an extra step; I’ve kinda gotten accustomed to the ease of the push-to-repo method and didn’t want to give it up.

Sharing that GitHub Action with you is the purpose of this post, in case it might be of use to those who use both Firebase Hosting and the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static site generator.

*(Whoa, Hugo and not [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) any more? Yes. See the [epilogue](#epiloguehead) for more on that.)*

This GitHub Action purposely does **not** use the widely used and excellent [GitHub Actions for Hugo](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-hugo) by [Shohei Ueda (peaceiris)](https://github.com/peaceiris) to install Hugo during the build process, because—as was the case with [Andrew Connell](https://andrewconnell.com), whose example I followed and to whom I am grateful for the information he imparted in “[Automated Hugo Releases With GitHub Actions](https://www.andrewconnell.com/blog/automated-hugo-releases-with-github-actions/)”—I preferred having more control over that exact part.

Enough talk; on with the GitHub Action. Of course, it’s based on two assumptions: (a.) you’ve initialized your repo for Firebase, thus creating the `.firebaserc` and `firebase.json` files mentioned at the end; and (b.) you’ve stored your Firebase token—called below by `${{ secrets.FIREBASE_TOKEN }}`—in your repo’s **Secrets**. If you don’t **have** a Firebase token, you get that with `firebase login:ci` from the CLI, as explained in the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#cli-ci-systems). You’ll note that I have `npm run build` in the *Build site with Hugo* step; but that’s peculiar to my formerly-using-[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) repo (a long story) and, in fact, only does `rm -rf public && hugo --gc --minify`—so you may want to use a variation of that, instead, if you’ve kept *your* Hugo repo Node-free. The Hugo version shown is the latest as of this post’s original publication; set it as you wish.[^versionInfo] I’m using the [extended version](https://gohugo.io/troubleshooting/faq/#i-get-tocss--this-feature-is-not-available-in-your-current-hugo-version) because, sometimes, I support [SCSS through Hugo Pipes](https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/scss-sass/); I switch the themes back and forth among SCSS, PostCSS without Tailwind, and PostCSS with Tailwind as situations warrant.[^diffThemes]

[^versionInfo]: Just be sure the version conforms to how it shows up in the Hugo release filename, since this reference helps build that name for the download process in the GitHub Action; always check the [Hugo releases page](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases) to be sure about the accurate filename.

[^diffThemes]: I now have this site’s repo set up so that there are **three** themes for Hugo’s use—one with purely SCSS, one with CSS-on-PostCSS (but still no Tailwind), and one with Tailwind. So, now, depending on which I want to use, I can simply switch themes in the site’s <code>config.yaml</code> file.


```yaml
name: CI-Hugo-site-to-Firebase

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

env:
  HUGO_VERSION: 0.75.1 # steps below will pick extended version

        env:
          FIREBASE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.FIREBASE_TOKEN }}
          # Other args should come from .firebaserc and firebase.json
```

## Epilogue

So, what up, homie? At least, some of you may be thinking that, in so many words.

Yes, it's true: I'm back with the Hugo SSG after nearly ten months of peace from my infamous “[dance](/posts/2019/12/sorta-strange-ssg-trip)” among multiple SSGs. As for why, it’s actually a mercifully short story. I can assure you it has **absolutely nothing** to do with a change of opinion about Eleventy—as I hope my laudatory words about it in “[A normal person’s guide to static websites](/posts/2020/09/normal-persons-guide-static-websites)” made clear. I still tremendously admire Eleventy and its great community, and think it's an excellent choice for anyone wanting to build one's website, and even more so if one is interested in a JavaScript-based SSG. On that score, one can’t possibly do better than Eleventy.

The TL;DR version for the change: after much thought, I felt an overwhelming desire to return to the **simplicity** I had in the early days of building and running this site. That led me back to the single-binary, all-in-one Hugo (with its built-in support for SCSS).[^WMsgone]

[^WMsgone]: By the same token, I also decided to give up [webmentions](https://indieweb.org/webmention) and all the ongoing technical debt they required—even though [I obviously knew how to get them working in Hugo, too](/posts/2020/04/webmentions-three-ssgs-3)—in favor of more easily added and maintained commenting.

Yes, some not-so-simple things—most definitely including Firebase Hosting—may be nerdy fun, but I decided I wanted much less complexity on the other parts of the site. So I hit the **Rewind** button, and that’s where we are.

It is, if you’ll pardon the unintentional wordplay, as *simple* as that.

<div class="yellowBox">
  <p><strong>Note</strong>: Decided to leave Firebase Hosting a few days later, since it appeared I might <em>occasionally</em> have a chance of exceeding the free tier’s 10&nbsp;GB monthly traffic limit, which is the skimpiest such allowance of all the hosts I’ve considered during the aforementioned “lurch.” (To be fair, Firebase doesn’t really push itself as a solution for this kind of free-tier use.) I knew of this limit ahead of time, of course, but didn’t know whether it would truly be a factor; figured the only way I’d find out would be to give it a try and see what kinds of numbers I got. Once I knew and did the math—well, that was all she wrote.</p>
