A few days ago, I issued [a post](/posts/2022/02/static-tweets-eleventy-hugo/) explaining how to embed fully static Twitter content in your [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev/)- or [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)-based website. (If you haven’t yet read that post, please do so before proceeding, so you can better understand what follows below.)

The Eleventy-based solution I offered gets Twitter data from Version 1.1 of the Twitter Developer API, while the Hugo-based solution accesses Twitter’s public syndication API. Although these two approaches work fine as of now, I hinted that each could run into trouble in the future, especially since (a.) Twitter is actively encouraging migration to its newer **Version 2** Developer API and (b.) the public syndication API is discomfitingly old by internet standards.

Thus, here’s a quick update on where all that stands.

## V.2 and Eleventy

After Kyle Mitofsky, the maintainer of the `eleventy-plugin-embed-tweet` plugin, saw my post, he responded via Twitter that he “should probably look into updating the Twitter API to use v2 .&nbsp; .&nbsp;. in case they drop support [of v.1.1].” Soon thereafter, he created [an issue](https://github.com/KyleMit/eleventy-plugin-embed-tweet/issues/15) on the plugin’s GitHub repository about performing just such an update. I was very pleased to see this positive response, and hope he will have the time to bring this about soon. Meanwhile, I still highly encourage use of his plugin in Eleventy sites; after all, it’s highly unlikely that Twitter will break v.1.1 in the *near* future.

## V.2 and Hugo

In the previous post, I offered a [shortcode](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/) to perform the static tweets stuff on a Hugo site. However, I was concerned about the shortcode’s dependence on the aging public syndication API; so, since then, I’ve spent a few days coming up with what I hope will be a better answer: *another* shortcode, called `stweetv2`. It’s very similar to `stweet` but uses the v.2 Twitter Developer API, which should enable it to work for quite some time.

### Handling credentials

Using `stweetv2` requires you to have a Twitter Developer account and supply your Twitter-assigned **Bearer Token** as an environment variable, both in local development and in production when you build to your chosen host. Actually, the build-to-host part is pretty easy, since each host has ways to let you safely store such sensitive variables for automatic injection with each build. As I said in the previous post (regarding the Eleventy plugin’s reliance on private Twitter credentials):

> .&nbsp; .&nbsp; . you’ll have to supply .&nbsp; .&nbsp;. [the credentials] to your site host, so it can access them during each build (*e.g.*, here are instructions for [Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/environment-variables/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables), and [Cloudflare Pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/build-configuration#environment-variables)).

But, for Hugo, the potential hang-up is in *local* development, where you obviously want to confirm that everything works *before* you try building your site on the host. Unlike how many JavaScript-based [SSGs](https://jamstack.org/generators/) work, Hugo doesn’t recognize content in a project’s `dot.env` file, which is typically where you’d store sensitive variables like the `BEARER_TOKEN` variable that `stweetv2` must access in order to “talk to” Twitter’s v.2 Developer API.

Fortunately, after I asked on Hugo’s Discourse forum about how to handle this in local development, I [received some great help](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/keeping-api-keys-secret-on-github-using-a-env-file/25283/14). Here’s the bottom line: if you’re using macOS or Linux (including Linux on Windows, such as through [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)), install the [`direnv`](https://direnv.net/) shell extension. `direnv` injects the required `BEARER_TOKEN` variable (and any others you may wish to store in `dot.env`) during your local development process. Once `direnv` is up and running, you’ll be good to go with adding `stweetv2` to your Hugo site.

What if you’re developing in Windows without using WSL? Unfortunately, `direnv` isn’t available for that setup. Instead, you can write a [shell script](https://www.howtogeek.com/261591/how-to-create-and-run-bash-shell-scripts-on-windows-10/) for your usual Hugo development command—*e.g.*, `hugo server`—with Hugo’s `env` command to add the `BEARER_TOKEN` at launch, as [explained](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/#configure-with-environment-variables) in the Hugo documentation. (**Just make sure you don’t commit the shell script**, of course!) For example, here’s one with a fake `BEARER_TOKEN` of `123456789a`:

{% raw %}
```bash
env BEARER_TOKEN=123456789a hugo server
```
{% endraw %}

### The `stweetv2` shortcode

Here’s an example of `stweetv2` in action, using the same tweet I featured in the previous post. In your Markdown, you include:

{% raw %}
```md
{{< stweetv2 "1487140202141425673" >}}
```
{% endraw %}

.&nbsp; .&nbsp;. which gives you:

{% tweet "1487140202141425673" %}

And here’s the `stweetv2.html` shortcode itself. As in the case of the `stweet` shortcode, the CSS therein is left to you, but you can use your browser’s Inspector tool on the tweet example above to see how I handled it.

{% raw %}

## Testing with `cURL`

By the way, there are times when Twitter’s APIs don’t respond because of some outage. If that happens during your development process, as it indeed did when I was finishing up work on `stweetv2`, you can confirm that it’s Twitter’s fault, not yours, by using the [`cURL` command](https://developer.ibm.com/articles/what-is-curl-command/) to submit your request to the API. For example, the `cURL` version of what we did above to get that tweet—again substituting `123456789a` for a real `BEARER_TOKEN`—is:

{% raw %}
```bash
curl "https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets?ids=1487140202141425673&expansions=author_id,attachments.media_keys&tweet.fields=created_at,text,attachments,entities,source&user.fields=name,username,profile_image_url&media.fields=preview_image_url,type,url,alt_text" -H "Authorization: Bearer 123456789a"
```
{% endraw %}

In fact, the [Twitter Developer portal](https://developer.twitter.com/) has tools that let you auto-build such `cURL` commands to see what the API gives you based on the options you select. I found these tools invaluable while building `stweetv2`; and, if you choose to tinker with it for your own purposes, I suspect they’ll aid you, too.
