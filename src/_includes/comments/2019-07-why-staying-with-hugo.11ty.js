  <p class="commentBody">Interesting read. Any chance you'd be willing to open source the attempted site, bugs and all, as a learning tool? I'd be pretty interested to try to get your site working, and in the process understand how gatsby handles a set of "real-world" requirements.</p>

  <p class="commentBody">I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s already history. I didn&rsquo;t want all those thousands of node modules taking up space on my Mac. :-) I do use Time Machine so it&rsquo;s probably on there somewhere, but I wouldn&rsquo;t know which version to recover.</p>

  <p class="commentBody">Thank you for the really interesting reading! Nico here. And I have to say that I feel for you there!</p>
  <p class="commentBody">Also, I think you raise some very valid and important topics, which for me are food for thought:</p>
  <p class="commentBody">One of them being that <em><strong>documentation</strong></em> is something excessively...(how do you say in English when someone looks to the side so they don't see you? That's what I mean! Like &quot;ignored&quot; more or less). The fact a developer will use a certain framework/library/etc. does not tell you nothing about their background or objective. Making no assumptions, good documentation can be built.</p>
  <p class="commentBody">I also have more comments but this is already too long lol. In short, thanks for the great reading!</p>

  <p class="commentBody">Given how long I yakked in this article, you have no need to apologize. :-) Thanks for your kind words and insights.</p>
