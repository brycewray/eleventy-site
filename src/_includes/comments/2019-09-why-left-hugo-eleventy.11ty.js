  <p class="commentBody">Great post and very interesting. I hadn't heard of Eleventy before. That's one thing I love about using a static-site generator is how easy it is to change should you need to. I used several before I settled on Pelican. I briefly thought about changing to Hugo, but decided it against it once I read the docs.</p>

  <p class="commentBody">Thank you. Yes, until Gatsby Experiment I, I&rsquo;d never heard of it, either, and at first I erroneously lumped it in with the others as not quite sufficient for my needs. Once I read its docs more thoroughly and got a better grasp of its extensibility, I realized I&rsquo;d missed the point entirely &mdash; as at least one triumphant Eleventy supporter reminded me yesterday after I released this post. :-)</p>

  <p class="commentBody">Thanks for this writeup about 11ty :- ) I'm about to create a blog for Talkyard, ... and found your article about 11ty when searching for 11ty versus Gatsby. To me, Gatsby is ... complicated. And with cryptic error messages that make my blood pressure rise. <span class="pokey">(Maybe I'll want to use Gatsby for the main website, some time later, which might need complicated sliders and buttons and widgets, hmm.)</span></p>
  <p class="commentBody">Nice to read that 11ty seems to be as simple as I originally expected all static gens to be :- )<br />
  (I noticed you've since switched back to Hugo, however, for me, probably 11ty is better &mdash; I think I'll need Javascript plugins.)</p>
  <p class="commentBody">Going to try this theme: <a href="https://hylia.website/posts/a-simple-post/" rel="nofollow">https://hylia.website/posts/a-simple-post/</a></p>

  <p class="commentBody">My continuing experimentation <strong>in the background</strong> (!) makes it increasingly clear that Gatsby is only for those who are thoroughly into React. Maybe someday I&rsquo;ll get it, but I&rsquo;m not holding my breath. But, yes, if your purposes are better served by a JS-based SSG, I emphatically recommend Eleventy. It is wonderfully easy to use and customize, especially if you have sufficient JS knowledge, and its build speed is surprisingly close to Hugo&rsquo;s, especially in league with Netlify.</p>
