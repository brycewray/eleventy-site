I could've done this with some long, drawn-out legalese borrowed from a website designed to *create* that legalese, but there was no need for it.

My site and I **don't** store your personal information---but, just in case I need to be clearer:

- This site **does NOT** store your personal information **in any way**. Period. That's thanks in part to its use of [Fathom Analytics](https://fathomanalytics.com) for analytics and [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com) for site search.[^GAdata]

[^GAdata]: Data that was collected at one time through [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com) is being deleted by my request---expected completion date is 2020-08-07, according to Google---and even, when the data was active, I never used it to identify any individual.

- The webmentions or other third-party comments that appear on certain pages occur only because the persons leaving them chose to do so in a public setting online. Such persons may at any time request deletion from this site of their third-party content, by sending an email to bw@brycewray.com.[^tweets]

[^tweets]: In the case of past tweets that showed up as webmentions through my use of [webmention.io](https://webmention.io) and [Bridgy](https://brid.gy), I may have only a limited ability to delete them from my site, but will do what I can; you may also want to go back and delete the actual tweet.

That same email address is also where to send any questions about other privacy-related matters for this site.
