I could've done this with some long, drawn-out legalese borrowed from a website designed to *create* that legalese, but there was no need for it.

My site and I **don't** store your personal information---but, just in case I need to be clearer:

- This site **does NOT** store your personal information **in any way**. Period. That's thanks in part to its use of [Fathom Analytics](https://fathomanalytics.com) for analytics and [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com) for site search. 

- The webmentions or other third-party comments that appear on certain pages occur only because the persons leaving them chose to do so in a public setting online. Such persons may at any time request deletion from this site of their third-party content, by sending an email to bw@brycewray.com.[^tweets]

[^tweets]: In the case of past tweets that showed up as webmentions through my use of [webmention.io](https://webmention.io) and [Bridgy](https://brid.gy), I may have only a limited ability to delete them from my site, but will do what I can; you may also want to go back and delete the actual tweet.

That same email address is also where to send any questions about other privacy-related matters for this site.

## Notes about external services

### Google Analytics

Data collected through my former use of [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com) was deleted by my request on 2020-08-09. Even when the data was active, I never used it to identify any individual.

### Google Fonts

When I learned that the use of [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) *served from* Google transmit a visitor's apparently **not** anonymized IP address[^Issue1495] to Google, I quit using this product (and suggesting to others that they use it) and, instead, served from my own site any typefaces that aren't part of the so-called "[system font stack](/posts/2018/10/web-typography-part-2)."

[^Issue1495]: For the discussion that convinced me to go this route after my initial skepticism about its necessity, see the Google Fonts GitHub issue, "[GDPR compliance](https://github.com/google/fonts/issues/1495)" (known by many simply by its number, 1495).

### Embedded videos

I no longer embed YouTube or other sites' videos, since they can and do transmit personal information through cookies. In the two instances where I formerly did---"[Some curmudgeonish thoughts](/posts/2018/11/some-curmudgeonish-thoughts)" and "[Coherence and COVID-19](/posts/2020/03/coherence-covid-19)"---I replaced them with clearly identified links to their original locations, and footnoted each link with a reference and link to this privacy policy.

### Twitter content

I no longer embed tweets, since they can and do transmit personal information through cookies. I have replaced formerly embedded tweets with just their text content combined with clearly identified links to their original locations, and footnoted each link (or set of links where multiple tweets were quoted, as in the case of "[Backtracking to Big G](/posts/2019/08/backtracking-to-big-g)") with a reference and link to this privacy policy.
